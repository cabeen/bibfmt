Pybtex is a BibTeX-compatible bibliography processor written in Python.\ |br|
You can simply type ``pybtex`` instead of ``bibtex``.

.. rst-class:: doc-links

    For more details, see :doc:`docs:index`.


How is Pybtex different from BibTeX
===================================

Pybtex aims to be 100% compatible with BibTeX.
It accepts the same command line options, fully supports BibTeX's ``.bst``
styles and produces byte-identical output (if not, please `file a bug
report`_).

Additionally,

* Pybtex is Unicode-aware.

* Pybtex supports :doc:`bibliography formats <docs:formats>` other than BibTeX.

* It is possible to write formatting styles in Python.\ |br|
  As a bonus, Pythonic styles can produce HTML, Markdown and other markup
  besides the usual LaTeX.

Pybtex also includes a :doc:`Python API <docs:api/index>` for managing
bibliographies from Python.
